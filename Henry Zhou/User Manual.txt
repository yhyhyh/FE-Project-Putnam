User Manuscript for CVaR method back-testing system

In order to run the back-test:
(1) Excute mvt_fit_sim.R to generate a set of .csv file in the current directory. 
	(e.g. 100.csv, 120.csv, etc)
(2) Run multi-period.m, the module will plot the net-value series and store other 		detail information in file "result.csv"
(3) Open "result.csv" to see net-valus's changes, transaction costs and more analysis.

Having any problems ruuning the code, welcome to contact Yuheng Zhou (607-279-4276).
